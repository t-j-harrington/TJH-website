I graduated from the University of Manchester and have since continued learning through [professional roles](/about-me/work-history) and [formal training](/about-me/training). This page provides an overview of my educational history until that point.

## University of Manchester

I completed a Japanese Studies BA Hons degree and received a grade of 2:1 with distinction in translation and spoken Japanese.

In this degree I learnt a lot about the Japanese language and also cultural context through many modules. In addition to Japan-focused modules, I also completed courses in Media Studies and teaching English as a foreign language.

My dissertation examined and provided solutions to the Japanese welfare system known as 'Public Assistance'.

### Waseda university (早稲田大学)

As part of my degree, I completed a one year placement at [Waseda university](https://www.waseda.jp/top/) in Tokyo. Classes were focused on practical Japanese language skills such as debate, presentations, transcription, grammar and more.

I also completed fieldwork for my dissertation, visiting municpial welfare offices and carrying out interviews and gathering materials.

### Optional modules



## Chichester college

I attended Chichester college and got A levels in English Language, Law, Media Studies, and Pure Maths.
