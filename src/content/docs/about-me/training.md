As a technical writer, I regularly complete training to widen my skillset and also participate in various communities and follow a range of publications.

## UX Design with Figma

I completed this course with [Experience Haus](https://experiencehaus.com/) in 2024.

### What I learnt

This course covered both practical Figma skills and design principles such as...



### Why I did this course

I chose to do this course because as a technical writer, you often have to work in Figma prototypes. Especially when contributing to UX/UI text with designers and product managers.

### What I've done with this course



## HTML, CSS and Javascript

I completed this course at [Brighton Metropolitan College](https://www.brightonmet.ac.uk/) in 2023.

### Why I did this course



## Websites and communities

As a technical writer, I try to keep on top of the latest technologies. As such, I follow a number of websites, blogs, and newsletters. I also participate in some communities.

### Websites

- [**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com/): An anonymous message board with user-submitted content and upvote system. People often share the latest breakthroughs in science and technology, along with other geekery. This is a good place to get exposed to new technologies and be inspired.
- [**Tom Johnson's blog**](https://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/): 
- [**Console**](https://console.dev/): This is a weekly newsletter that provides an overview of new developer tools and betas. Some of these relate to documentation and it is in fact how I found out about [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), which powers this site.

### Communities

- [**WriteTheDocs**](https://www.writethedocs.org/index.html): 
- [**Silicon Brighton**](https://siliconbrighton.com/): 
- [**Hacktoberfest**](https://hacktoberfest.com/):
