I graduated from the University of Manchester in 2016, and have since continued learning through professional roles and formal training. This page provides an overview of my educational history until that point.

## University of Manchester 

In this degree I learnt a lot about the Japanese language and also cultural context through many modules. In addition to Japan-focused modules, I also completed courses in Media Studies and teaching English as a foreign language.

This degree included a 1 year placement at Waseda University in Tokyo, where classes were delivered entirely in Japanese.

My dissertation examined and provided solutions to the Japanese welfare system known as 'Public Assistance'.

I received a grade of distinction in both translation and spoken Japanese.
